This project aims to detect brain tumors using MRI images of the brain and the exact location of the tumor that is present in the brain. The main objective of this project is to classify whether a person has a brain tumor or not. The project performs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the dataset to classify using the ResNET50 model. If the tumor is present in the brain, the project performs image segmentation to find the exact location of the tumor using the ResUNET model. If there is no tumor present, the project skips the image segmentation process.
