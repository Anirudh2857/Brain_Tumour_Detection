The project built above is for detecting Brain Tumour. We use two datasets the first dataset consists of the MRI images of the brain and the second dataset consist of the exact location of the tumour that is present in the brain. Our main objecctive in this project is to classify wether the person has Brain Tumpur or not. Firstly we perfrom CNN on the dataset to classify this is done by using the ResNET50 model. If the tumour is present in the brain later on we perfrom image segmentation to find the exact location of the tumour,If there is no tumour present we don't perfrom the image seagmentaion. Image segementation is the process of extracting the features of the image at a pixel level. We use the ResUNET model for perfrming image segmentation.The dataset is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
